# pupil-analysis-MATLAB
Step 1. For our purpose we obtained video files ".seq". To analyze our video files in MATLAB we need to convert ".seq" to "tiff".

Step 2. Respectively, inside the folder where ".seq" files are located, you should create a folder with the name "tiff". You should indicate the pathway for converted to "tiff" files to this folder.


Step 3. Now, next to the "tiff" folder create a new folder called "test".

Step 4. Take 6-10 tiff files and put it inside folder "test"

Step 5. Open MATLAB. We are going to utilize the first script that allows us to analyze movies with our data. In the main window open "browse for folder", then, open the folder that has a name "pupil segmentation" -> select folder. In "Current Folder" window click right mouse button -> select "add to path" -> current folder.  Then select "eye_analysis_8_DM_CL8.m".

Step 6. In the new window where the script is located find a green "play" button on the control panel. It is called "run"

Step 7. Click it, then find your folder "test" and select this folder in order to test how applicable your contrast value to obtain the best version of graphs.

Step 8. When you select the folder "test" a window will appear. " please enter a value for contrast adjustment". You can enter different values. I used values from 0.03 to 0.15

Step 9. After MATLAB will be done with the analysis you see the graphs.
